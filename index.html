<h1>THIS SITE IS STILL IN PROGRESS</h1><br>
<p><b>Introduction: </b>Hello! Thank you for your interest in donating. My name is Kate Slinchenkova and I am a senior getting a double major at Cornell in Biology and Chemistry. I grew up in Dnipro, Ukraine before moving to America in 2008, leaving the majority of my family back in Ukraine. Although I used to visit often, now I will not be able to return due to the current attacks. To help, I have spent most of my free time helping my loved ones and their efforts in supporting the community the only way I can from so far away: financially. Below you will find some details regarding my work so far.<p>
