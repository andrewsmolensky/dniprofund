<h1>THIS SITE IS STILL IN PROGRESS</h1><br>
<p><b>Introduction: </b>Hello! Thank you for your interest in donating. My name is Kate Slinchenkova and I am a senior getting a double major at Cornell in Biology and Chemistry. I grew up in Dnipro, Ukraine before moving to America in 2008, leaving the majority of my family back in Ukraine. Although I used to visit often, now I will not be able to return due to the current attacks. To help, I have spent most of my free time helping my loved ones and their efforts in supporting the community the only way I can from so far away: financially. Below you will find some details regarding my work so far.<p>
<br>
<p><b>What is this fundraising for?</b> My fundraising has been split between civilians buying supplies for refugees and shelters as well as the ICU where my grandpa works in Ukraine (the majority going towards the hospital) and a pediatric clinic run by my aunt’s friend who she studied with in medical school in Dnipro. 
The support for refugees and shelters comes from Olena Bezborodko (a friend) and Anastasiia Druziuk (a cousin). Anastasiia lives in Vinitsa and has been using her home as a shelter for refugees en route to Poland. She has been buying supplies and food, as well as clothing for those who left in a hurry, to aid them in their travel to Poland. She provides almost daily instagram reports (@dr_druiziuk) of what she accomplishes and what plans she has for the future. Olena is from Dnipro but traveled over 580 miles to Lviv (a city on the way to Poland) before giving away her tickets to a mother and her daughter. Since then, she has been based in Lviv, buying and shipping medical supplies to other cities by train via a volunteer network. She began to travel back to Dnipro on 3/7/22, and will be working with local shelters to support refugees. She also provides daily updates on her instagram (@bezborodko_alena) 
The majority of what I have collected so far has gone to the ICU in Dnipro’s City Hospital #6. While other hospitals are clearing out and making space in anticipation of wounded soldiers and volunteers, my grandpa’s hospital is taking all current patients, specifically those in 
critical condition. They are in desperate need of antibiotics, painkillers, gauze, and other essential medical supplies as most of their supplies and budget has been redirected toward military support. 
The pediatric clinic has been helping soon-to-be-moms fleeing from the bombing in the east as well as children. Through donations, we have already been able to provide some relief. Most recently, a mom from Kharkiv was able to keep her pregnancy due to medicine bought with the donations after coming to Dnipro to seek shelter and heal her injuries. However, the need is ongoing and urgent and any donations will be put to use immediately.. 
If you would like to donate, I would love to leave the choice of who your funds go to up to your discretion, whether you choose to donate through another organization, through me, or directly to the mentioned individuals. When you donate through me, please, feel free to specify where you would like your donation to go.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>How do I donate?</b> My family and I have been using paysend.com to transfer funds directly to cards. Paysend is secure (PCI DSS certified), has low fees, and all transfers are sent in real time. Wise has also been a great program. Wire transfers through the bank have a significantly longer wait time, and many of them have exorbitant fees. Both of these are directly antithetical to our goals for the fundraising, as this is a developing and ongoing immediate crisis. A family friend, Oleksii Tretiak, has provided his business card to be used for deposits which he can then transfer to the hospital. Below, you will find my information for donations and my contact information. If you would like to donate directly, please contact me and I will provide the information of the individual you would like to donate to. The only reason I do not have their information listed below is to prevent widespread knowledge of their card information to diminish the chance of card fraud in case the document is widely distributed. If you choose to donate directly, I would strongly recommend using paysend.com as the funds reached the intended recipients within 40 minutes of confirmation. The only issue I have experienced with paysend was my bank requiring confirmation (as a fraud protection measure).

Thank you again for taking the time to read about my efforts and for your consideration in supporting the ongoing humanitarian work of locals in Ukraine. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me via phone or email. No amount is too small, and everything adds up. If you want to help but are more comfortable helping a larger organization, I will also be happy to point you in the right direction. so please feel free to contact me. Finally, I am working with my boyfriend, whose grandparents also remain in Dnipro, to set up a website with all of this information as well as photos of the supplies that donations were able to provide and responses from families who were aided. Once that is up and running, I will make sure to share. 
Sincerely,
