<p><b>Welcome to my website!</b> I'm Andrew, an Electrical Engineering student at Purdue University. This site's purpose is to let anyone to get to know me better, as well as to showcase my skills and <a href="projects.html">projects.</a><p>
<br>
<p><b>Technical skills:</b> C, Java, Python, Linux, Networking, MySQL, Assembly, Electrical Lab Equipment, HTML, Javascript, 3D Printing/Modeling</p>
<br>
<p><b>Other skills:</b> Communication, Teaching, Leadership, Troubleshooting, Problem Solving, Persistence</p>
<br>
<p><b>Some background on me:</b> I currently live in Indiana but have been moving around my entire life. I have been very passionate about computers and new technologies, ever since my father installed Linux as my main operating system on my computer in elementary school. I love learning, especially about ground-breaking hardware and software, and consider failure to be the best teacher. My technical hobbies include 3-D printing, network/server management, and soldering/board repairs. I also enjoy Geocaching, hiking, science-fiction novels, and story-based video games.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Before I graduate,</b> I would like opportunities to bring together all the skills I've learned and all the professional development I've received so far at college. I'm looking for a chance to grow as a leader and an engineer, and I am interested in positions that allow me to learn new technologies and to experiment with my own capabilities. In the next decade I'd like to see myself in a position with more mentoring roles that allow me to share my skills and experiences (I enjoy teaching almost as much as I love learning). I aspire to eventually have an opportunity to work on a ground-breaking world-changing technology. In the long run, I am committed to constantly educating myself and bettering myself as an engineer.</p>
