<p><b>How do I donate?</b>If you would like to donate, I would love to leave the choice of who your funds go to up to your discretion, whether you choose to donate through another organization, through me, or directly to the mentioned individuals. When you donate through me, please, feel free to specify where you would like your donation to go. My family and I have been using paysend.com to transfer funds directly to cards. Paysend is secure (PCI DSS certified), has low fees, and all transfers are sent in real time. Wise has also been a great program. Wire transfers through the bank have a significantly longer wait time, and many of them have exorbitant fees. Both of these are directly antithetical to our goals for the fundraising, as this is a developing and ongoing immediate crisis. A family friend, Oleksii Tretiak, has provided his business card to be used for deposits which he can then transfer to the hospital. Below, you will find my information for donations and my contact information. If you would like to donate directly, please contact me and I will provide the information of the individual you would like to donate to. The only reason I do not have their information listed below is to prevent widespread knowledge of their card information to diminish the chance of card fraud in case the document is widely distributed. If you choose to donate directly, I would strongly recommend using paysend.com as the funds reached the intended recipients within 40 minutes of confirmation. The only issue I have experienced with paysend was my bank requiring confirmation (as a fraud protection measure).
