<h3><b>Dnipro 6th City Hospital</b></h3>
<p>My grandpa, Dr. Vasiliy Slinchenkov, has been an ICU anaesthesiologist for over 40 years, working in Dnipro’s Sixth City Hospital. In the beginning of the war, his department was receiving critical patients from all around the city as other hospitals prepared to take in soldiers. We were fundraising to stock the ICU to fill immediate needs. The urgency has expanded as the hospital began receiving wounded refugees and soldiers from all around the country. The hospital has been using the funds raised to order antibiotics, gauze, IV fluids, and other essential medical supplies. They have  received zero aid from large international organizations and all donations sent by us have been used immediately. All transfers are facilitated by Oleksii Tretiak, a good family friend, who has provided us with his business’s card and transfers anything received to the hospital’s bank account.

<h3><b>Zdorove Pokolinya Clinic</b></h3>
<p>The director of the clinic in Dnipro, Nataliia Duplenko, went to medical school with my aunt and reached out to her when the situation became dire. The clinic, generally a private clinic for all ages, has been accepting refugees with and without insurance. Particularly, mothers and children. They were unable to sustain the influx of people without the means to pay for themselves. Donations have helped them purchase essential meddical supplies and provide refugees with the funds to buy food, clothing, and other supplies for their journey out of the country after their injuries are treated. The director’s card is used for transfers with memos indicating that the funds are for the clinic. She has provided pictures of materials

<h3><b>Local Volunteer Efforts: Dnipro</b></h3>
<p>Alena Bezborodko and I met during my last trip to Ukraine through a mutual friend I used to go to school with. Alena has been working non stop since the war started to help supply shelters, troops, and hospitals. Although she initially traveled to Lviv to make her way to Poland, she ended up giving away her tickets to a mom and her young daughter. She then spent a week and a half buying supplies in Lviv and sending them, by train, to hot spots. Afterward, she was back in Dnipro helping hospitals. She has personally delivered medication and supplies to the Sixth City Hospital, upon my request, as well as to the Mechnikov Hospital and refugee shelters. The Mechnikov Hospital is one the largest medical institutions in Ukraine and often gets the most severe of cases, making their need for medications extremely dire. Donations have helped her keep up her work and she provides many updates on her purchases through instagram. (@bezborodko_alena)

<h3><b>Local Volunteer Efforts: Vinnytsia </b></h3>
<p>My dad’s cousin, Anastasiia Druziuk, is a hair stylist in Vinnytsia who has been helping refugees passing on their way to Poland. She has been aiding refugees fleeing from the east by arranging places for them to stay along their route and then housing them when they reach her. Before they arrive at her house, they send her a list of supplies they need. Supplies often include things like baby food and diapers, non-perishables, batteries and flashlights, and clothing. Donations have helped her buy those items for them and provide funds for further travel.
